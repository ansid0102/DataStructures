# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! Here, I'm honing my problem-solving skills by tackling various DSA problems and sharing my solutions.

## About

In this repository, you'll find solutions to a variety of DSA problems implemented in different programming languages. Each problem is categorized based on its topic, making it easier to navigate and explore specific areas of interest.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Array and String Problems**: Solutions to problems related to array manipulation, subarrays, and string manipulation.
- **Linked List Problems**: Solutions to problems involving linked list manipulation, traversal, and merging.
- **Tree and Graph Problems**: Solutions to problems focusing on tree and graph traversal, manipulation, and properties.
- **Sorting and Searching Problems**: Solutions to problems involving sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and related data structures.
- **Dynamic Programming Problems**: Solutions to problems requiring dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.
- **Backtracking Problems**: Solutions to problems involving exhaustive search or trial-and-error techniques.
- **Bit Manipulation Problems**: Solutions to problems involving bitwise operations or binary representation.
- **Math and Probability Problems**: Solutions to problems requiring mathematical calculations or probability concepts.
- **System Design Problems**: Solutions to larger-scale problems focusing on designing scalable and efficient systems.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions and contribute your own implementations! Each problem directory contains a `README.md` file with a description of the problem and any additional instructions or notes. You can find the code implementations within each problem directory as well.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a problem that isn't already included in the repository or if you'd like to improve an existing solution, please feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions about the solutions or the repository in general, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to me directly.

Happy coding!
